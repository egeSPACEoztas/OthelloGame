# OthelloGame
 
My attempt at creating an othello game to the specifics of LMU's Programmierpraktikum 2020 project.

Data structure to hold the board information is implemented in DataStructure.java.

There seems to be a bug in JavaFx gui that keeps from accurate board information showning up.

And there is a bug with the nodes of the implemented search tree. In wich I couldn't use the functions of the coordinate object stored within the node.

Due to my limited time, and basic understanding of java it is half done currently.
